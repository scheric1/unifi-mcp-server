# Noridoc: tools

Path: @/src/tools

### Overview

- Contains all MCP tool implementations for the UniFi MCP Server, covering every area of UniFi network management from RADIUS to firewall to traffic monitoring.
- Each module corresponds to a functional domain (e.g., `radius.py`, `firewall.py`, `wifi.py`) and exports async functions that are registered as `@mcp.tool()` wrappers in `@/src/main.py`.
- Tools follow a consistent CRUD pattern: list/get/create/update/delete, with all mutating operations requiring `confirm=True` and supporting `dry_run` mode.

### How it fits into the larger codebase

- `@/src/main.py` is the sole consumer: it imports each tool module as an alias (e.g., `radius as radius_tools`) and wraps each function with `@mcp.tool()` to expose it to MCP clients.
- Tools call into `@/src/api/client.py` (`UniFiClient`) for all HTTP communication with the UniFi controller. Each function opens an `async with UniFiClient(settings) as client:` context for its request(s).
- Pydantic models from `@/src/models/` validate and serialize API responses before they are returned; raw dicts from the API are never returned directly.
- `@/src/utils/` provides three shared utilities used throughout: `audit_action` (mutation logging), `get_logger`, and `validate_confirmation` (enforces `confirm=True` guard).
- `@/src/config/` (`Settings`) is threaded through every tool function as a parameter so the tool layer is stateless.

### Core Implementation

- **Tool registration flow**: `src/tools/<module>.py` defines async functions → `src/main.py` wraps them in `@mcp.tool()` closures that capture the singleton `settings` object and forward all other arguments.
- **Payload construction pattern**: Update functions build a sparse `payload` dict from only the `Optional` arguments that are not `None`, then validate the payload is non-empty *before* opening the `UniFiClient` context. This prevents wasted network connections and allows `ValueError` to propagate cleanly in tests (see Things to Know).
- **Password/secret redaction**: Functions that handle credentials (`radius.py`) redact sensitive fields (`x_password`, `auth_secret`, `acct_secret`) in API responses and in audit log payloads before any data leaves the function.
- **Response normalization**: All API responses are normalized via `data = response if isinstance(response, list) else response.get("data", response)` followed by list-unwrapping, because the UniFi API inconsistently returns bare lists, wrapped lists, or wrapped dicts.
- **RADIUS module**: Covers RADIUS Profiles (`/ea/sites/{site_id}/rest/radiusprofile`), RADIUS Accounts (`/ea/sites/{site_id}/rest/account`), Guest Portal config (`/integration/v1/sites/{site_id}/guest-portal/config`), and Hotspot Packages (`/integration/v1/sites/{site_id}/hotspot/packages`). All four resources now have full CRUD.

### Things to Know

- **Empty-payload guard placement**: The `if not payload and not dry_run: raise ValueError(...)` check in update functions must occur *before* the `async with UniFiClient(...) as client:` block. Placing it inside the context manager causes it to be silently swallowed in tests because `AsyncMock().__aexit__` returns a truthy value, suppressing exceptions raised within the block.
- **RADIUS Account field mapping**: The MCP parameter `username` maps to the API field `name`; `password` maps to `x_password`; `vlan_id` maps to `vlan`. When `vlan_id` is provided during creation, `tunnel_type` (13) and `tunnel_medium_type` (6) are auto-set unless explicitly overridden.
- **API prefix split**: RADIUS Profiles and Accounts use the `/ea/` (Early Access) path prefix, while Guest Portal and Hotspot Packages use `/integration/v1/`. This split is significant when debugging endpoint availability across UniFi firmware versions.
- **Dry-run handling in update functions**: When `dry_run=True` and the payload happens to be empty, the empty-payload guard is skipped (`not dry_run` short-circuits), and the function returns a dry-run response indicating nothing would be changed.
- **Site UUID normalization for v2 API endpoints** (Bug #73): UniFi v2 API endpoints like `/firewall-policies` require short-names (e.g., "default") in URL paths, not full UUIDs. The `UniFiClient` maintains a `_site_uuid_to_name` cache mapping UUIDs to short-names. Functions in `firewall_policies.py` normalize the `site_id` parameter before building endpoints via `client._site_uuid_to_name.get(site_id, site_id)`. This ensures backward compatibility—if `site_id` is already a short-name, `.get()` falls back to returning the original value. Both `list_firewall_policies()` and `update_firewall_policy()` apply this normalization.
- **MatchingTarget enum expansion** (Bug #72): The `MatchingTarget` enum now includes `APP` value, enabling app-based traffic filtering in firewall policies (e.g., blocking streaming applications). This value appears in both source and destination zone matching rules and was previously missing from the enum, causing validation errors when real UniFi controllers returned `matching_target="APP"` in policy responses.
