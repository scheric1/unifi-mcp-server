## Getting Started

### Introduction

Each UniFi Application has its own API endpoints running locally on each site, offering detailed analytics and control related to that specific application. For a single endpoint with high-level insights across all your UniFi sites, refer to the [UniFi Site Manager API](https://developer.ui.com/).

### Authentication and Request Format

An API Key is a unique identifier used to authenticate API requests. To generate API Keys and view an example of the API Request Format, visit the Integrations section of your UniFi application.

**Authentication Header:**
```
X-API-KEY: {YOUR_API_KEY}
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to your UniFi controller:

**Integration API (Recommended):**
```
https://{CONTROLLER_IP}/proxy/network/integration/v1
```

**Local API:**
```
https://{CONTROLLER_IP}/proxy/network/api
```

```

### Best Practices for Effective Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact values (IP addresses, port numbers, VLAN IDs)
2. **Use Context**: Reference existing configurations ("the Guest WiFi", "my main switch")
3. **Request Confirmation**: Ask the AI to explain changes before applying them
4. **Combine Operations**: Chain related tasks in a single conversational flow
5. **Ask for Validation**: Request health checks or impact analysis before major changes
6. **Leverage Dry-Run**: Ask the AI to show what would happen without actually making changes

**Example Multi-Step Conversation:**

```
User: "I need to set up QoS for my Zoom calls. What do you recommend?"

AI: "I recommend creating a QoS profile with priority level 5, DSCP marking 34 (AF41),
     and guaranteed bandwidth of 5 Mbps down / 2 Mbps up. This ensures high-quality
     video even during network congestion. Would you like me to create this?"

User: "Yes, but first show me what the configuration would look like in dry-run mode."

AI: [Shows dry-run output with exact configuration values]

User: "Perfect, go ahead and create it. Also, create a traffic route to apply this
      QoS profile to all UDP traffic on port 8801 (Zoom media)."

AI: [Creates QoS profile and traffic route, confirms success]

User: "Now validate that this is working correctly."

AI: [Shows active traffic flows with DSCP marking applied, confirms QoS is active]
```

## Filtering

Explains how to use the filter query parameter for advanced querying across list endpoints.

Some `GET` and `DELETE` endpoints support filtering using the `filter` query parameter. Each endpoint supporting filtering will have a detailed list of filterable properties, their types, and allowed functions.

### Filtering Syntax

Filtering follows a structured, URL-safe syntax with three types of expressions.

#### 1. Property Expressions

Apply functions to an individual property using the form `<property>.<function>(<arguments>)`, where argument values are separated by commas.

**Examples:**
- `id.eq(123)` - checks if `id` is equal to `123`
- `name.isNotNull()` - checks if `name` is not null
- `createdAt.in(2025-01-01, 2025-01-05)` - checks if `createdAt` is either `2025-01-01` or `2025-01-05`

#### 2. Compound Expressions

Combine two or more expressions with logical operators using the form `<logical-operator>(<expressions>)`, where expressions are separated by commas.

**Examples:**
- `and(name.isNull(), createdAt.gt(2025-01-01))` - checks if `name` is null **and** `createdAt` is greater than `2025-01-01`
- `or(name.isNull(), expired.isNull(), expiresAt.isNull())` - checks if **any** of `name`, `expired`, or `expiresAt` is null

#### 3. Negation Expressions

Negate any other expressions using the form `not(<expression>)`.

**Example:**
- `not(name.like('guest*'))` - matches all values except those that start with `guest`

### Filterable Property Types

| Type | Examples | Syntax |
|------|----------|--------|
| `STRING` | `'Hello, ''World''!'` | Must be wrapped in single quotes. To escape a single quote, use another single quote. |
| `INTEGER` | `123` | Must start with a digit. |
| `DECIMAL` | `123`, `123.321` | Must start with a digit. Can include a decimal point (.). |
| `TIMESTAMP` | `2025-01-29`, `2025-01-29T12:39:11Z` | Must follow ISO 8601 format (date or date-time). |
| `BOOLEAN` | `true`, `false` | Can be `true` or `false`. |
| `UUID` | `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` | Must be a valid UUID format (8-4-4-4-12). |
| `SET(STRING\|INTEGER\|DECIMAL\|TIMESTAMP\|UUID)` | `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` | A set of (unique) values. |

### Filtering Functions

| Function | Arguments | Semantics | Supported Property Types |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| `isNull` | 0 | is null | all types |
| `isNotNull` | 0 | is not null | all types |
| `eq` | 1 | equals | STRING, INTEGER, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, BOOLEAN, UUID |
| `ne` | 1 | not equals | STRING, INTEGER, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, BOOLEAN, UUID |
| `gt` | 1 | greater than | STRING, INTEGER, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, UUID |
| `ge` | 1 | greater than or equals | STRING, INTEGER, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, UUID |
| `lt` | 1 | less than | STRING, INTEGER, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, UUID |
| `le` | 1 | less than or equals | STRING, INTEGER, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, UUID |
| `like` | 1 | matches pattern | STRING |
| `in` | 1 or more | one of | STRING, INTEGER, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, UUID |
| `notIn` | 1 or more | not one of | STRING, INTEGER, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, UUID |
| `isEmpty` | 0 | is empty | SET |
| `contains` | 1 | contains | SET |
| `containsAny` | 1 or more | contains any of | SET |
| `containsAll` | 1 or more | contains all of | SET |
| `containsExactly` | 1 or more | contains exactly | SET |

#### Pattern Matching (`like` Function)

- `.` matches any **single** character. Example: `type.like('type.')` matches `type1`, but not `type100`
- `*` matches **any number** of characters. Example: `name.like('guest*')` matches `guest1` and `guest100`
- `\` is used to escape `.` and `*`

## Networks

Endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and inspecting network configurations including VLANs, DHCP, NAT, and IPv4/IPv6 settings.

> **API Limitations (verified 2026-04-13):**
> - The v1 Network API only exposes `management`, `name`, `enabled`, `vlanId`, and `dhcpGuarding`. DHCP range, subnet, purpose, and isolation settings are NOT available through the v1 API.
> - The legacy REST API (`/rest/networkconf`) exposes more fields (DHCP, subnet, purpose) but `purpose` is **immutable after creation**.
> - **Network-level client isolation** ("Isolate Network" in the UI) is not available through any documented API. Use `clientIsolationEnabled` on WiFi Broadcasts for SSID-level isolation instead.
> - The legacy REST API uses `"vlan"` (not `"vlan_id"`) for the VLAN number field.

## Quality of Service (QoS)

Manage Quality of Service profiles, ProAV (Professional Audio/Video) protocols, Smart Queue Management (bufferbloat mitigation), and policy-based traffic routing rules.

### Overview

UniFi's QoS system provides comprehensive traffic prioritization and shaping capabilities:

- **QoS Profiles**: Define traffic priority levels (0-7) with DSCP marking (0-63) for bandwidth guarantees
- **ProAV Protocols**: Pre-configured templates for professional audio/video standards (Dante, Q-SYS, SDVoE, AVB, RAVENNA, NDI, SMPTE 2110)
- **Smart Queue Management (SQM)**: Bufferbloat mitigation using fq_codel or CAKE algorithms
- **Traffic Routes**: Policy-based routing rules with match criteria (IP, port, protocol, VLAN) and actions (allow, deny, mark, shape)

**Best Practices:**
- Use priority levels 5-7 for real-time traffic (voice, video conferencing)
- Apply DSCP marking EF (46) for voice, AF41 (34) for high-quality video
- Enable SQM on WAN interfaces <300 Mbps for best bufferbloat mitigation
- Use reference profiles (voice-first, video-conferencing, cloud-gaming) as starting points
- Test QoS rules during peak hours to validate bandwidth guarantees

## Backup and Restore

Comprehensive backup and restore operations for disaster recovery, configuration migration, and system maintenance.

### Overview

UniFi's Backup and Restore system provides critical disaster recovery capabilities:

- **Backup Creation**: Create network or system backups on-demand or on schedule
- **Backup Management**: List, download, validate, and delete backup files
- **Restore Operations**: Restore from backups with automatic pre-restore safety backups
- **Automated Scheduling**: Configure daily, weekly, or monthly automated backups
- **Operation Monitoring**: Track backup and restore progress in real-time
- **Cloud Sync**: Optionally sync backups to UniFi Cloud (requires account)

**Backup Types:**
- **Network Backups** (<10 MB): Network settings, device configurations, WiFi networks, firewall rules (fastest, recommended for frequent backups)
- **System Backups** (10-100+ MB): Complete OS, application, and device configurations (comprehensive, recommended for major changes)

**Best Practices:**
- Always create a pre-restore backup before restoring (enabled by default)
- Schedule automated daily network backups for production environments
- Keep at least 7-30 days of backup retention
- Download critical backups to external storage before major changes
- Test backup validation before restore operations
- Monitor controller connectivity during restore (controller may restart)
